        <h3>Your plan</h3>
        <p>This is your fat-rich, low-carb eating plan. This plan is distinctive for its exceptionally high-fat content, typically 70% to 80%. We suggest following this plan until the desired amount of weight is lost.</p>
        <h3>How it works?</h3>
        <p>This is a diet that causes ketones to be produced by the liver, shifting the body's metabolism away from glucose and towards fat utilization. when you eat food high in carbs, your body produces glucose and insulin. While glucose is used as the main source of energy, insulin secretion is produced to down regulate your glucose levels in the blood stream. Insulin is also responsible for storing fat in our body and if your body produces too much of it, you put on weight.</p>
